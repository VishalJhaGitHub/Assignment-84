    "#Feature selection plays a crucial role in anomaly detection by identifying the most relevant features that contribute to distinguishing normal instances from anomalies. Selecting appropriate features can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of anomaly detection algorithms. By reducing the dimensionality of the data, feature selection helps to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and can improve the accuracy of anomaly detection models. It also aids in reducing noise and irrelevant information, leading to more robust anomaly detection performance."
